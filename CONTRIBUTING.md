# How to Contribute to this Repository

This repository requires all changes made by other users besides the repository owner to be made through Pull Requests.

Constributors should create their own branches or forks and carry out all development work there. Once the additional content reaches sufficient mass, the contributor(s) should submit a Pull Request.

### Contents of a Pull Request

The title of a Pull Request should describe very briefly the overall theme of the changes.

The body of a Pull Request should describe the specific changes made (see [changelog.md](https://jasonwu00.github.io/Event-Horizon-ES-Mod/Documentation/changelog) for a reference on how to structure your list of changes) and the reason why you (the contributor(s)) believe that this is a good addition or change to the project.

The repo owner ([JasonWu00](https://github.com/JasonWu00)) will review open Pull Requests from time to time and either merge them, ask for further clarification via comments, or choose not to merge them.
