  "Description": "The creation of nanite fabricators was spurred on by early contact between the Bunrodea and Korath. The hull-walking microbots of Korath System Cores allowed Korath ships to make repairs without the need of a spaceport, a trait that the Bunrodea favored for use in their scout vessels.",
