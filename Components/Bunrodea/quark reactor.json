  "Description": "Bunrodean reactors appear to be named after types of exotic stars that either once were or still are considered theoretical to humanity. A quark star was first discovered by humanity near the Shangri-La system during the 28th century, a star with core temperatures and pressures so extreme that quark matter is produced."
