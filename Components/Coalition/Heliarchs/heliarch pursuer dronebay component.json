  "Description": "Occasionally, when a Heliarch cadet shows promising results in dogfighting simulations, they are allowed to fly a ship of their own: the Pursuer. Though certainly not as durable as the other fighters in Coalition space, this Kimek design is cheaper to produce and capable of outrunning any other Coalition ship.",
