  "Description": "Though still unable to replicate Quarg power generation technology, Heliarch science teams are constantly looking to realize their most recent guess on how they work. For this larger module, a steady stream of injected antiprotons catalyzes reactions in carefully confined fusion plasma, extracting as much power as physically possible.\n\nThis advanced fusion reactor was designed for the most powerful Heliarch warships. Its structure has not changed significantly in the millennia since the first battle with the Quarg, but each generation of reactors is made slightly more efficient than the previous ones.",
