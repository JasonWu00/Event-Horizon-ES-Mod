  "Description": "Solar power is sufficient for commerce, but excessive thriftiness is seldom a winning strategy in warfare. For ships that must have a reliable energy source to power weapons, the Heliarchs use compact nuclear reactors. A beam of antiprotons triggers fusion in tiny injected fuel pellets, allowing for a complete burnup far more efficient than would otherwise be possible.",
