  "Description": "As the Unfettered began to understand how the biochemical cell works, they have studied different organisms for industrial use on their own worlds, especially some of the unique extremophiles. While that study has so far still been fruitless, it has inspired the engineering through which the Ruby Generator channels excess heat towards the shield generators in order to directly infuse that energy into the shield array. The process lowers the overall heat levels on the ship considerably, but the redundant wiring systems to handle it cause more initial build up.",
