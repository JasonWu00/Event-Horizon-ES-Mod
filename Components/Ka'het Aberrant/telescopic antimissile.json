  "Description": "Oddly enough, this antimissile system resembles an array of scanners and telescopes. Such an assortment of sensing devices was certainly not intended to be used as a weapon, but somehow enough power has been pumped through this scanner's optics to make it a potent antimissile defense.\n\nThe various lenses and mirrors that make up a large telescope seem to be used to focus the emitted beam, giving this antimissile system a very long range.",
