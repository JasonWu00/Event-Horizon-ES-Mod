  "Name": "Spatial Inversion Chamber",
  "Description": "This vast chamber is the key component of a larger system that manufactures Jump Drives and Spatial Inversion Chambers. It contains a rupture in spacetime which emits vast amounts of heat and energy, and radiates extra-universal matter. If the energy and heat are not suitably contained, the drive will explode with a force sufficient to shatter a small moon. Adventurous captains will use this as a dangerous power source, if they have sufficient cooling to keep their ship from exploding.",
