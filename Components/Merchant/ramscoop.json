  "Description": "In the early days of space exploration, when ships could travel through half a dozen systems before encountering an established colony where they could refuel, ramscoops were an essential piece of equipment, harvesting plasma from the solar wind to refill your hyperspace fuel tanks. Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first.",
