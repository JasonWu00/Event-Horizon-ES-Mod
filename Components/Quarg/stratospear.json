  "Description": "While those who can directly match the power of Quarg energy weapons are rare, some foolish younger races have attempted to oppose the Quarg with missile-based nuclear weapons, hoping for their destructive power to even the playing field. These Quarg anti-missile defenses, firing pinpoint beams of energy, have often dashed these hopes, targeting projectiles from considerable range and ensuring that only the most powerful missiles are capable of getting near a Quarg ship.",
