  "Description": "The Ember Waste is the sort of place where only a very foolish captain would travel without some sort of device for replenishing hyperspace fuel. While this risk is non-existent in Remnant ships due to their \"gills,\" which are effectively built-in ramscoops, some captains prefer to speed up the process by adding additional capacity. For the rare captain braving the area in non-Remnant ships, this ramscoop is not particularly powerful, but it allows a ship to explore without fear of getting stranded.",
