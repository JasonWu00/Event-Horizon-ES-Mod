  "Description": "This Sheragi cooling system is primitive at best, but it works both actively and passively, allowing it to dissipate much more heat than a simple radiator would. It does, however, drain a lot of power when subjected to the heat of battle. It also includes cryogenic tanks to hold some additional fuel, which is used as a temporary heat reservoir."
