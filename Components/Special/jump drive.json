  "Description": "The workings of the jump drive are a total mystery. The best that human scientists have been able to find out is that this device is a containment field for matter in a state that cannot normally exist in this universe; if the drive is opened up, the field collapses and its contents disappear. Therefore, even though a few jump drives have been captured over the years, it has so far proved impossible to reverse engineer them.",
