Notes to self:

See documentation.txt for info on IDs.
Factions will be: Merchants, Pirate, Republic, Syndicate, Free Worlds, (yet to be made) Hai, (hidden) Sheragi, Remnant, Coalition, Wanderer, Korath, Quarg (+ Drak), and Pug.

Select ships from Remnant, Coalition, Wanderer, Korath, and all Quarg and Pug ships are to be made unavailable in smugglers.
Quarg and Pug are intended as "gatekeeper" factions with super caps (Archon and Arfecta respectively) until the mod is fully balanced.
Use existing images for reactors, batteries, weapons, and engines.
Jump Drive as improved teleport device.
Scanners as mix of rangemasters, reloaders, and damage boosters.

Add quests for Emerald Sword, Arfecta (end game), and other rare ships.

---------------

Plans:

Add Kestrel as unique ship for those who assisted in making the mod.
Make Arfecta and Emerald Sword uncraftable and require a quest chain.
Make Arfecta the only moderately hard way to beat Archon.
