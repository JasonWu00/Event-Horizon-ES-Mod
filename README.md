Note that links in this README page leads to the github.io page versions of various files and not their github.com versions.

## Description

`Event-Horizon-ES-Mod` is a mod for Event Horizon (the mobile/PC game, not the movie) using assets from the open source game [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky). This repository contains the source files for the mod and compiled files of past versions of the mod.

## History

At around June of 2021 I decided that this project would be a good idea and started collecting assets and learning how mods for Event Horizon work. On July 14, 2021 I compiled the first version of the mod.

The first few versions were released informally on the official Discord server for Event Horizon. Later versions were released on an [itch.io page](https://404-found.itch.io/event-horizon-ES-Mod).

Note that the account uploading to the itch.io page uses a personal username instead of my actual name. This is because I was initially not keen on allowing random people on the Internet to know my real name.

## Questions

Q: "This isn't technically impressive. It doesn't show off any flashy or marketable skills. Why are you showing this to us?"

A: It's work that I am proud of.

Q: "What do all of these `.json` files do?"

A: Some helpful people over at the Event Horizon official Discord server compiled this ["Database User Manual"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TsxbbtUkF_OKdpotKNQEiPqvW3xi8CTUipUiFz51CZY/edit?usp=sharing) that details exactly what everything does. This manual explains everything far better than I possibly can, but it is a bit of a long read.

## Installation instructions

The steps to install Event Horizon and this mod are as follows:

1. Download Event Horizon.
   - Android: from the Google Play Store.
   - PC: from [here](https://github.com/PavelZinchenko/EventHorizon-Issues/releases/tag/latest_build). Download `EventHorizon_win64.zip` to your device and extract it to a folder of your choosing.
2. Go to the location where the Event Horizon game files are stored at.
   - Android: `storage/Android/data/com.ZipasGames.EventHorizon/files`
     - Some Android devices do not allow the user to access these files through the built-in file manager. You may wish to download a file manager of your choice from the Google Play Store to aid in this step.
   - PC: wherever you placed the unzipped folder.
3. Create a folder at that location named `Mods`. Capitalization matters.
4. Download whichever version of this mod you want from the Versions folder and move the mod file to the `Mods` folder.
   - WARNING: Changing from a later version to an earlier version of the mod might lead to unforeseen damage to your save files.
5. Launch Event Horizon.
   - Android: press on the Event Horizon app icon on your device.
   - PC: Double-click on `Event Horizon.exe`.
      - Note: `Event Horizon.exe` must be in the same directory as the `Mods` folder.
6. Activate the mod.
   - Select the `"Settings"` button on the bottom right of the game's main menu.
   - Out of the six buttons on the left side of the settings menu, select the wrench and screwdriver symbol.
   - You will be shown a list of "Available modifications". Select this mod (usually titled `Endless Sky [version number]`), then select the "Yes" button on the popup warning window.
   - Wait until the game finishes loading the mod.
7. The mod is now loaded.
