## Description

`Event-Horizon-ES-Mod` is a mod for the game Event Horizon (the mobile/PC game, not the movie) using assets from the open source game [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky). This repository contains the source files for the mod and compiled files of past versions of the mod.

## History

At around June of 2021 I decided that this project would be a good idea and started collecting assets and learning how mods for Event Horizon work. On July 14, 2021 I compiled the first version of the mod.

The first few versions were released informally on the official Discord server for Event Horizon. Later versions were released on an [itch.io page](https://404-found.itch.io/event-horizon-es-mod).

Note that the account uploading to the itch.io page uses a personal username instead of my actual name. This is because I was not keen on allowing random people on the Internet to know my real name. I request that anyone visiting that page from this link keep things that way.
