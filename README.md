# Event-Horizon-ES-mod

Author: [JasonWu00](https://github.com/JasonWu00).

## Description

`Event-Horizon-ES-Mod` is a mod for Event Horizon (the mobile/PC game, not the movie) using assets from the open source game [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky). This repository contains the source files for the mod and compiled files of past versions of the mod.

## History

At around June of 2021 I decided that this project would be a good idea and started collecting assets and learning how mods for Event Horizon work. On July 14, 2021 I compiled the first version of the mod.

The first few versions were released informally on the official Discord server for Event Horizon. Later versions were released on an [itch.io page](https://404-found.itch.io/event-horizon-es-mod).

Note that the account uploading to the itch.io page uses a personal username instead of my actual name. This is because I was not keen on allowing random people on the Internet to know my real name. I request that anyone visiting that page from this link keep things that way.

## Pre-emptive question answering

Q: "This isn't technically impressive. It doesn't show off any flashy or marketable skills. It won't matter for whether you get into an internship or job or not. Why are you pinning it to your profile?"

A: These statements are true and I am aware of this. I pinned this repo on my profile not because I think a recruiter might see it and be impressed but because it's something I put effort into and am sort of proud of.
