  "Description": "The Sasumata is the chief scout ship of the Bunrodea. While not designed for combat, this stealth transport vessel is still capable of holding its own against some smaller warships; its four fighter bays turn the Sasumata into a force to be reckoned with when its fighters are deployed."
