  "Description": "The Arach Hulk is an ungainly, lumbering behemoth of a ship, but with its side pods removed it becomes the much more maneuverable Spindle. Because of its much lower cargo space, usually the only reason a fleet would include a Spindle is if they are planning on picking up new cargo pods at their destination."
