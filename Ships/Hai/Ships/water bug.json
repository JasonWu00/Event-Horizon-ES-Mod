  "Description": "The design of the Water Bug is almost as old as the Aphid, but until recently it never saw much use. A spike in aggression from the Unfettered Hai has led the tougher and more well-defended Water Bug to see an increase in popularity over its little brother, the Aphid. The Water Bug is now the most widely used Hai freighter, comprising the bulk of all Hai merchant fleets."
