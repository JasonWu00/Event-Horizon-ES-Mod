  "Description": "Centuries ago, when the initial, carrier versions of the Lenmig'sraor 52-T were being developed, the Kaltheim had no fighters - as a result, the Bulkort 2-V was what was developed for the new carriers, iterating on old Kaltheim designs from previous wars in their species' history. However, thanks to the decline in use of carriers by the Kaltheim, many Bulkort 2-Vs have been dismantled for parts and scrap metal, leaving just a few hundred remaining - some in active service, and some collecting dust in museums alongside their carrier counterparts. With recent events and increasing conflict with previously unknown alien groups, the Kaltheim has revived this design as a stopgap.",
