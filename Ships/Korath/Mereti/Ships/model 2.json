  "Description": "The Model 2 is the very earliest stage of spacefaring Kor Mereti automaton. These tiny ships, incapable of even controlling their own motion, are ejected into space regularly from Kor Mereti planets, and made to fend for themselves. Few survive, but those that do, grow in the depths of space, eventually gaining the ability to travel through hyperspace.",
