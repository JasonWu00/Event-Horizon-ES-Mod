  "Description": "The Jackal is notable for being one of the earliest warships that was designed with \"freelancer\" pilots in mind, rather than for corporate or law enforcement use. In its heyday, the Jackal contended with the Berserker for the title of the most popular Interceptor-class ship in human space. However, the Jackal's age and inflexibility regarding new developments in weaponry led to a decline in sales that eventually saw its manufacturer absorbed by the shipyard of its age-old rival, the Betelgeuse Shipyards Berserker.",
