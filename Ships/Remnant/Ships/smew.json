  "Description": "The Remnant have long favored turns of action that avoid putting crew directly at risk; though their Terns are a rather effective result of this ideology, the Remnant still had to face the fact that, eventually, one of their manned ships was going to end up too crippled to escape to safety. To that end, the Smew was developed; though quite lightly armed, Smews are capable of carrying a considerable quantity of cargo and passengers for a ship of their size, and are durable enough to absorb some fire from enemies while doing so."
