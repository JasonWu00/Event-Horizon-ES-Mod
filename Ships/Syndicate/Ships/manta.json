  "Description": "After their Quicksilver light warship with its armament of Particle Cannons became a large success with convoy escorts and planetary defense forces, Megaparsec decided to develop a larger ship with similar maneuverability but heavier firepower. The Manta is the result: a ship with enough long-range firepower that fleeing from a battle with it is almost impossible.",
