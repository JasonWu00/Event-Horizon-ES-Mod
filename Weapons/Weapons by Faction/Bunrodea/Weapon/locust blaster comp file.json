  "Description": "The Locust Blaster might look small, but its destructive potential for its size is nothing to scoff at. A single blaster is capable of sustaining 1,200 rounds per minute. While each individual projectile from the blaster deals rather insignificant damage, the sheer deluge of projectiles can rip even the largest of ships to shreds in due time.",
