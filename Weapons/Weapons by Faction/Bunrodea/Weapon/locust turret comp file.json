  "Description": "Although Bunrodean ships typically rely on the power of their forward facing guns and fill any turret mounts with anti-missile systems, they have developed a turret mount for the Locust Blaster. This turret carries three Locust Blasters that all fire at once, resulting in an astonishing 3,600 projectiles per minute being thrown at the target.",
