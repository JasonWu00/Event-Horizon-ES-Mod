  "Description": "The Mandible Cannon is a significant part of the Bunrodean arsenal due to its versatility. Its range exceeds that of smaller weapons, and its size allows it to be used in numbers on most Bunrodean ships. However, the energy draw required to fire is rather significant, particularly for Bunrodean ships that rely on solar cells.",
