  "Description": "The Swarm Pod proved to be an effective weapon in early conflicts with the Korath by overpowering early Korath anti-missile defenses. But just as the Bunrodea developed technology to combat Korath weaponry, the Korath did the same, prompting them to create their own rapid-fire anti-missile turret that limited the usefulness of the Swarm Pod against some Korath targets.",
