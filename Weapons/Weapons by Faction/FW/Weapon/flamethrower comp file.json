  "Description": "A crude but impressive-looking weapon, the Flamethrower ignites your hyperspace fuel and directs a stream of it towards your adversaries. The damage it does is relatively minor, but it can be useful for causing a target that is already operating near its thermal capacity to overheat, temporarily taking it out of the fight."
