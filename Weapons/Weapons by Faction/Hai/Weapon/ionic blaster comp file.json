  "Description": "The Unfettered conflict with the rest of the Hai has put pressure on them to gain a technological edge, despite their limited resources. The Ionic Blaster is a result of that pressure. It is much smaller than the venerable Ion Cannon, while also doing more raw damage for its size. It also is still able to apply some of the same energy draining effects, but Unfettered scientists have pushed it towards a higher relative focus on jamming enemy weapons.",
