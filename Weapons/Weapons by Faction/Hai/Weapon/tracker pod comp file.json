  "Description": "Trackers are fast and accurate homing weapons. Although not as powerful as most human missiles, Trackers boast a significant hit force, helping to prevent the escape of whoever is unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end. Their only weakness is their large turning radius: if a Tracker misses its target, it takes a long time to turn around.",
