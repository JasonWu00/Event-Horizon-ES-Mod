  "Name": "Nucleolysis Beam",
  "Description": "This beam weapon creates a field inside which otherwise stable atomic nuclei rapidly decay. This effect seems to be inversely proportional to the mass of the nucleus, causing isotopes like deuterium to break down at a higher rate than heavier elements. As the resultant products have a higher energy state than the original nucleus, the beam cools its target, defying conventional thermodynamics.",
