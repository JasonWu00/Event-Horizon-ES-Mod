  "Description": "Kaltheim ships have frequently had problems with preventing enemy ships from jumping into hyperspace; while Phase Missiles are somewhat effective, they are also rather expensive and can be foiled by anti-missile systems. As a result, the Engine Destabiliser was built, designed to mess with the output of the target's engines, making their main thrusters and steering ineffective for a time. The Destabiliser also has the side effect of the target ship being thrown off into space once the weapon's effects begin to recede.",
