  "Description": "The Slush Beam is a small beam weapon, designed by the Kaltheim centuries ago specifically for their Bulkort 2-V fighters, in order to allow the fighters to properly utilise both of their gun ports. As a result of condensing the design down to only take up 17 tons of outfit space, the Slush Beam's damage output is much lower than other Kaltheim weapons.\n\nAs the Bulkort 2-V is rarely used nowadays due to the conversion of many Kaltheim carriers into hunter-killers, the Slush Beam is instead used on larger Kaltheim warships to fill out spare gun ports on ships which cannot fit any other weapons.",
