  "Description": "Essentially a TPC stretched out into a firing rig, this 'defensive' artillery weapon fires a ball of plasma that quickly spreads into a devastating wave. Alone, it has little impact on shields, but the sheer heat and impact force it transmits can melt and buckle hull plating and even blow away smaller ships.",
