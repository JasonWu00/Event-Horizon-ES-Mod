  "Description": "The Javelin Pod fires a rapid stream of unguided missiles. A Javelin Pod does far more damage than any gun of a comparable size, and has a longer range as well, but once a ship has expended all of its ammunition it must leave combat and find a planet where it can buy more, which makes Javelins less useful in protracted battles.",
