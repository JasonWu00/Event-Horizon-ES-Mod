  "Description": "The Meteor Missile is the cheapest and simplest homing weapon available in human space. Meteors are quickly destroyed by anti-missile systems, and their infrared tracking systems have trouble homing in on targets with low heat levels. Nevertheless, their large warheads can spell doom for poorly-defended targets when the missiles are fired in great numbers.",
