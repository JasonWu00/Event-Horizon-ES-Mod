  "Description": "In an act that would make Dr. Richard J. Gatling spin in his grave with the ferocity of the barrels of his invention, the Gatling Turret was born when a resourceful pirate thought to replace the Energy Blasters on a Blaster Turret with a pair of Gatling Guns. Ever since, the dominion of the Gatling Turret has spread across the Southern Rim, terrorizing merchants and law enforcement alike with its unparalleled ability to tear apart the hulls of ships.",
