  "Description": "Laser Turrets are hated by fighter pilots because it is nearly impossible to dodge them once you are within their reach. This turret carries a pair of lasers and can swivel almost instantly to fire on new targets as they approach. Laser Turrets are especially useful when mounted on slow-moving freighters to fend off packs of small pirate vessels.",
