  "Description": "An enterprising engineer, presumably having decided that the Modified Blaster's already-frightening lack of safety control was insufficient, has taken two of the weapons and shoved them together in the same gun port, crudely welded together with fervid enthusiasm. Whether or not this weapon will destroy the target before it melts its own components is anyone's guess; perhaps the intent was that the twin barrels would intimidate enemies into submission before the weapon would have to be fired.",
