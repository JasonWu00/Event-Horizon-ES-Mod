  "Description": "A very simplistic explanation for this weapon is that it is making micro-tears in the fabric of space-time, then cauterizing them together again. Should not the Ember Wastes cry at the necessity of such weapons?\n\nThese massive weapons require special hardpoints, and are built in such few number that the Remnant distribute them directly on an as-needed basis. Due to the prodigious energy and fuel requirements, only the most massive of Remnant ships can support regular use of these weapons.",
