  "Description": "In knife-edge battles with Korath raiding parties, every second matters for a Remnant ship. These drop racks allow a larger Remnant ship to launch a handful of EMP torpedoes at Korath forces to their flanks or rear, bypassing the several seconds needed for a launcher-fired torpedo to turn around and acquire a target.",
