  "Description": "This weapon was originally developed in an attempt to reverse engineer a long-range energy projectile favored by an alien species that the Remnant encountered nearby. In the process they discovered that by adding more energy to the projectiles they could do a lot more damage in exchange for shorter range, and the Thrasher Cannon was born.",
