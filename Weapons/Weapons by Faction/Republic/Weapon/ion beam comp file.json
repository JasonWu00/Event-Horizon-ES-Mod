  "Description": "The Ion Beam is a recent development by Ursa Polaris, a beam weapon that causes less damage per second than any beam on the market. It is extremely good however, at causing interruption of electrical and shielding systems. The impact plume of this weapon is especially spectacular, as ionized particles splash violently and ablate your target's shields and hull.",
