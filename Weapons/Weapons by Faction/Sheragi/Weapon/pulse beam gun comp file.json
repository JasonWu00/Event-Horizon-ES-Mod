  "Description": "This beam weapon was created in conjunction between Human and Sheragi engineers by altering the ancient but powerful design of the Sheragi Anti-Missile. It is more balanced in its effectiveness at damaging shields than most Sheragi weaponry, as influenced by the existence of shield reliant Human ships. Despite its immense power, one should beware of the high energy cost of this weapon.",
