  "Description": "The Particle Cannon works by accelerating a short burst of particles to near-relativistic speeds. When mounted on a ship that can turn fast enough to keep it trained on approaching ships, it becomes a nearly unbeatable weapon, capable of destroying smaller ships before they can even approach close enough for their comparatively short-ranged weapons to be effective.",
