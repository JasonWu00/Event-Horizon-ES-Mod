  "Description": "As the Sidewinder Missile is maneuvrable enough that it would not benefit much from a conventional turret mount, large Sidewinder Missile systems typically take the form of space-efficient vertical launch arrays. These weapons are capable of rapidly launching many missiles in quick succession, overcoming anti-missile defenses through volume of fire.",
