Notes to self:

Ship build files id start at 1001 (Shuttle).
Ship files id start at 301 (Shuttle).
Faction files id start at 201 (Merchants).
Factions will be: Merchants, Pirate, Republic, Syndicate, Free Worlds, (yet to be made) Hai, (hidden) Sheragi, Remnant, Coalition, Wanderer, Korath, Quarg (+ Drak), and Pug.
Faction ids are in ascending order.
Tech ids start at 301 (Shuttle).
Modules start at 1001.

Select ships from Remnant, Coalition, Wanderer, Korath, and all Quarg and Pug ships are to be made unavailable in smugglers.
Quarg and Pug are intended as "gatekeeper" factions with super caps (Archon and Arfecta respectively) until the mod is fully balanced.
Use existing images for reactors, batteries, and engines. Use recolored vanilla modules for weapons.
Cooling is obsolete in EH - perhaps make them reduce energy consumption while have reactors increase consumption.
To balance this, all vanilla reactors would also need energy consumption.
Interference plating to be made as all-type resist armor.
Jump Drive as improved teleport device.
Scanners as mix of rangemasters, reloaders, and damage boosters.

Add quests for Emerald Sword, Arfecta (end game), and tributing planets.

Plans:

Merchants: freighters and transports, interceptors, light warships, ion engines, fuel cells, nucleiovoltaics, thermal ionics, batteries, shield gens
Pirates: all marauder ships, medium and heavy civilian warships, gatling gun, flamethrower
Republic: appropriate vessels, armageddon reactor, scanners, atomics
Syndicate: appropriate vessels, regenerators, nuke
Free Worlds: appropriate vessels, stack and fission reactors, plasma engines
Drones scattered across the three main factions.
Hai: appropriate ships, outfits, and drones
Remnant: see above
Coalition: see above
Wanderer: see above
Korath: see above
Quarg (Drak) + Pug: see above (buff arfecta and archon to fit), jump drive

Add Kestrel as unique ship for those who assisted in making the mod.
Make Arfecta and Emerald Sword uncraftable and require a quest chain.
Make Arfecta the only moderately hard way to beat Archon.
