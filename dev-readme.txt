Notes to self:

Ship build files id start at 1001 (Shuttle). Every faction has 100 ship build id numbers.
Ship files id start at 301 (Shuttle). Every faction has 100 ship id numbers.
Faction files id start at 201 (Merchants).
Factions will be: Merchants, Pirate, Republic, Syndicate, Free Worlds, (yet to be made) Hai, Remnant, Coalition, Wanderer, Korath, Quarg (+ Drak), and Pug.
Faction ids are in ascending order.
Tech ids start at 2001 (Shuttle).

Select ships from Remnant, Coalition, Wanderer, Korath, and all Quarg and Pug ships are to be made unavailable in smugglers.
Quarg and Pug are intended as "gatekeeper" factions with super caps (Archon and Arfecta respectively) until the mod is fully balanced.
Use existing images for reactors, batteries, and engines. Use recolored vanilla modules for weapons.
Cooling is obsolete in EH - perhaps make them reduce energy consumption while have reactors increase consumption.
To balance this, all vanilla reactors would also need energy consumption.
Interference plating to be made as all-type resist armor.
Jump Drive as improved teleport device.
